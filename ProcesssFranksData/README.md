Sub-directory contains MATLAB scripts to process and display Franks data from 
"Bolding KA,Franks KM 2018. Recurrent cortical circuits implement concentration-invariant odor coding. Science. Vol: 361(6407)"

1) Must first download data from CRCNS.org at: https://dx.doi.org/10.6080/K00C4SZB , click on THY1 link and download: processedTHY1.tar.gz AND ExperimentCatalog_THY1.txt
2) Run the script: getPlotTHY1.m, assumes ExperimentCatalog_THY1.txt is in same directory, and all data from processedTHY1.tar.gz is in sub-folder named 'processed'
